- [click]two my friend Andy talked about shifting left and shifting right
- he had this amazing talk about 8 software testing convictions, if you haven’t seen the talk or read it on his blog automationpanda.com, you are seriously missing out
- in his talk he mentioned a shift left - a popular idea for making sure to start the testing process early and implementing practices that help with delivering a high quality product even in early stages of development, using unit tests etc.
- a shift right is making sure that we don’t loose sight of what is happening once we ship a new feature

<!-- 
- testers are well aware of this - going through bug reports assessing severity, finding out how many people were affected by a defect in the app - we feel the pain of our users
- and developers - as I mentioned in the beginning - you have different things in mind and it’s just so easy to lose that mindset
- it’s oftentimes we testers create quality culture, but we can create a really good one

<!--
- in my previous job, we have come up with this system of how to classify bugs
- we would have two dimensions - quality and quantity
- these two dimensions would divide bugs into four quadrants
- so whenever we found a bug, we would place it into one of these four categories

- examples
    - a - incident, payment does not work, drop everything and fix
    - b - has high impact but does not affect that many users, fix as soon as possible, so we don’t lose trust of our customers
    - c - is a rather common thing, but it does not have too much impact
    - d - does not have a big impact, and does not affect many people
- this is something that everyone in company is able to understand and help shed light into current issues

<!--
- no matter if you are a ceo, work on helpline are a tester or an engineer - this shared model can keep us all focused on the right thing
- this kind of model help everyone get it - everyone understands what testers do
- everyone is shifting right, focuses on people
- because users don’t really care about how nice your framework is or how fast your test automation executes, they care about a working product
- we testers know it, it’s kinda the point of our job
- we as testers we can be the kind reminder for our developer friends to always think about the end user
