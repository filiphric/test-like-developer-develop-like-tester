<!-- 
- Iâ€™m going to circle back on the idea of shift left
- testing should start early, but we need to make sure that testing is actually something that can be done

<!-- 
- maybe as a tester you have been in situations when suddenly all your test failed
- you try to investigate see what happened
- and suddenly bam! developers introduced captcha to your app
- things like these should not happen
- testing is not an afterthought, testing is a strategy
- putting measures to make sure that your application is testable will help you as a developer

<!-- 
- so what can you do?
- add a switch that can turn off rate limiting for test environments
- program a tool that can help your test automation scripts with login
- help your team test in a way that will make sure that your code is properly tested
- create testing strategies as part of development
- ask not only - how will we build it, but how will we test it

My last advice is both for developers and testers
