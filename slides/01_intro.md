# Developers vs. testers

<!--
- best friends vs. being arch enemies.
- chances are, your workplace is leaning to the latter - But why is that? 
- We have the **same goals**
  - challenges, clients, product owner, boss, tools
  - want to achieve excellence in what we do.
- but we have **different** perspectives
  - areas of expertise, 
  - and dive deep into set of problems they solve
  - different language, different terms, different tools

# Developers vs. testers

<!--
- my personal experience being both development and testing, I definitely see some differences.

- As a tester, I try to think about the system as a whole, 
  - different inputs, and outputs, and risks.
  - all the things that could happen
  - different contexts in which the app is going to be used

# Developers vs. testers

<!--
- As a developer, I think about that much less. 
  - I need to architect different parts of application,
  - make sure components work well together, 
  - think about different design decisions, 
  - work out the structure and logic of various functions
  - make sure that the software will perform according to requirements

Living in both of these worlds at the same time got me thinking - why have these two roles fallen apart so much?
