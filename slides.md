# Test like a developer
# develop like a tester

<!--
- my name is Filip, I currently work as DevRel at Replay.io
- spent almost a decade at various positions in testing
- as a tester,  I spent my day writing test automation, talking to devs, manually testing, writing down notes, docs and performimg to my best abilities as a tester.
-  I also liked playing the developer role, mostly during my spare time
- I spent my evenings working on my homepage, creating and enhancing applications to test on my testing workshops, and dealing with all the developer stuff like bundlers, frameworks, css, databases, APIs and so on
- Basically, I spend a lot of time on **both tester and developer chair**. And this got me thinking. Whatâ€™s going on with these two groups of people?
